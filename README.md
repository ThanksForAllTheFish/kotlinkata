# Kotlin Kata
Attempt to learn [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/) basics by playing around with [code kata](http://codekata.com/kata/codekata-intro/).
 
## Kata02: Chop
Perform a binary search on an ordered array. Too lazy to come up with 5 implementations, so stick to 4 (2.5 would be a better definition, since one simply uses the native Kotlin/Java implementation and one is just a small optimization of another).
Introducing the [Spek](https://jetbrains.github.io/spek/index.html) testing frameworks (maybe will find more interesting cases to use it later on): because testing matters.

## Kata04: Data Munging
### Part 1: load weather file
Read the file `kata04/weather.dat`, then find the day with the smallest temperature spread (difference between second and third column)
### Part 2: load football file
Read the file `kata04/football.dat`, then find the day with the smallest difference between scored and taken goals (column F and A respectively)
### Part 3: reduce duplicated code
Identify and eliminate common pattern
